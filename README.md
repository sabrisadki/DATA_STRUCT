# DATA_STRUCT
README FILE:

The code contains two algorithms for checking the orthogonality of vectors using dot product. The first algorithm uses a dot_product procedure and the second algorithm uses a dot_product function. Both algorithms take input of n pairs of vectors to check for orthogonality.

The dot_product_p procedure calculates the dot product of two vectors and sets a Boolean variable called isOrthogonal to True if the dot product is zero, which means the vectors are orthogonal. The Check Orthogonality using Dot Product Procedure algorithm calls the dot_product_p procedure for each pair of vectors and displays a message indicating whether each pair of vectors is orthogonal or not.

The dot_product_f function calculates the dot product of two vectors and returns the dot product value. The Check Orthogonality using Dot Product Function algorithm calls the dot_product_f function for each pair of vectors, and checks if the dot product value is zero, which means the vectors are orthogonal. It displays a message indicating whether each pair of vectors is orthogonal or not.

Both algorithms use arrays of size n to store the vectors to check for orthogonality. The input data should be provided as an array of size n for both vectors.

Note: The code assumes that the input vectors have the same size.
